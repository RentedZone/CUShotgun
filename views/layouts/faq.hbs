        <h1 class="question">How can I join the team?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            If you have, or are working on getting your <a href="https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/firearms/licensing">PAL</a> (Possession and Acquisition Licence)
            the team would love to take you out to the range.
            <br>
            You'll get the chance to try a game of skeet, even if you don't have the equipment necessary!
            <br>
            The best way to get in contact with the team is through any of the socials below or
            by using the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>.

        <h1 class="question">What are events like?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            We normally hold events at <a href="https://www.sffgc.ca/">Smiths Falls Fish and Game Club</a>.
            <br>
            This allows for us to have fun breaking clays and trying out Trap and 5-Stand.
            <br>
            This is the perfect time for people who have never shot before, and those who've shot their whole life.

        <h1 class="question">Do I need a gun/license to attend an event?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            Not at all! We provide the guns and supervision, you provide the smiles.

    <div class="main-page-wrapper variable-size">
        <h1 class="question">What gear do I need?</h1>
        <p class="answer">
            If you are only planning on attending an event, you probably only need to bring some water, food, money,
            and a smile!
            <br>
            Eye and ear protection are always mandatory when operating a firearm, and so typically we can provide
            the ear protection,
            <br>
            but it will be on you to bring some eye protection (like sunglasses).
            <br><br>
            If you're interested in joining the team, you're going to, at the very least need your <a href="https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/firearms/licensing">PAL</a>.
            <br>
            Teammates can provide a shotgun if needed, but it is always recommended to buy your own.
            <br>
            You'll also want a belt and a <a href="https://www.cabelas.ca/product/96085/allen-eliminator-single-box-shell-carrier">shotshell carrier</a> (most of the team uses one of these).
